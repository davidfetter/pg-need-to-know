## Create a REST API using postgrest

- Download and install [postgrest](http://postgrest.org/)
- Create a [config file](http://postgrest.org/en/v5.0/install.html#configuration)
- Run `postgrest your-config-file`
- Using this API pre-supposes that you have an Identity Provider and an Authentication Server which can issue JSON Web Tokens according to the specifications of `pg-need-to-know` (read more about these in `auth-requirements.md`)
