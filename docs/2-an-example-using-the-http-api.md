## Using the HTTP API

The last example in  `1-access-control-model.md` showed how an administrator can use `pg-need-to-know` to set up access control rules based on data owners and data subsets, in a conceptual way. The rest of this document shows how one would use the HTTP API (provided by running `postgrest`) to implement this.
